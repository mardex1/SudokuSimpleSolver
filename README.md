# SudokuSimpleSolver

A simple Sudoku solver written in C. Heavily inspired on @badcodinghabits tutorial. Great for consolidating C knowledge.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mardex1/SudokuSimpleSolver.git
```

2. Run the code by running the makefile:

```
make
```

## In case you want to generate new python sudoku examples

1. Activate virtual enviroment for python using:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install necessary dependencies (just one :D): 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Modify and Run the python file:

```
python src/generate_sudoku.py
```


Feel free to sugest changes in the code, i'm not good at C.
